# Autonomous Crab Car

This repository contains the source code for a Senior Design Project of four students in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Clemson University.

## Description

The goal of the project was to design and implement a small-scale autonomous electric car capable of independent rotation up to 90 degress of each wheel. The car was controlled by a Raspberry PI running an Ubuntu OS. The autonomous capabilities of the car were developed using Computer vision and an Intel LiDAR L515.
